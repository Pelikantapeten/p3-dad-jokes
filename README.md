### Validator Testing 

Testing text and links

### Unfixed Bugs

- Using Colorama library but my tests are not working. When I do a print syntax with the provided syntax to change the font color "Hello World" is not printing.
  - <i>Used the wrong syntax. Needed to add a "+" sign before the string</i>
- Pure strings are using the selected colors but all prints from the worksheet are still white and I get a syntax error.
  - <i>Tried Termcolor library instead of Colorama library and it did the trick</i>
- Get error messages when I try to access a specific row in the worksheet
  - <i>Used the wrong syntax for the library Gspread. Tryed to install and import a different library but that was also problematic. Eventually I found the syntax for the Gspread library and it worked.</i>
